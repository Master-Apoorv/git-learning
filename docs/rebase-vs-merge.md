# Merge vs Rebase: When to Use What

Understanding when to use `git merge` versus `git rebase` is key to maintaining a clean and collaborative Git history.

## 🪢 Use Merge When:
- You're integrating changes from a shared branch like `main` into your feature branch.
- You want to preserve the true chronology of commits and reflect all merge events.
- The team values visibility into when branches were combined.
- Conflict resolution during merging should be recorded for future review.

## 🔄 Use Rebase When:
- You want to streamline your feature branch’s history before merging into `main`.
- You’re working solo and prefer a tidy, linear commit history.
- You’re syncing with the latest upstream changes to avoid redundant merges.
- You want to squash multiple feature commits into logical, atomic commits.

## ⚖️ Quick Tip:
Use `merge` for shared/public branches to retain context. Use `rebase` for personal/private branches to polish your commit timeline.

Maintaining clarity in history helps with debugging, peer reviews, and long-term maintainability. Choose wisely based on your workflow and collaboration style.
